# discordBot
Used Discord.js to build a bot for me and my friends discord server
 [x] - uses https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ to grab random dog images
 [x] - uses `ytdl` package to convert youtube audio to play Halo theme
    [ ] - upgrade to be able to search for and play youtube videos
 [ ] - Use spotify API to get details about users account
    [ ] - use information to play suggested song
    [ ] - tensorflow to get prediction model?
